  			<p>    New York City working horses have pulled carriages in Central Park for more than 150 years. Since its opening in 1858, Frederick Law Olmsted designed Central Park to be viewed from behind a carriage. A fairytale scenic view of the majestic park from behind a carriage became so popular that carriages soon began to specialize in Central Park tours. The invention of the automobile replaced horse-drawn carriages, but the New York City Central Park carriage horse tour remained. Today, more than 200 horses and over 360 employees are part of the century old industry Mayor Bill de Blasio vows to abolish.

        </br>   </br>
        Mayor de Blasio, along with animal rights advocates, argue the Victorian vestige does not belong in modern day Manhattan and should be replaced with vintage vehicles. They claim New York City carriage horses are treated inhumanely and contend that horses are not safe traversing midtown Manhattan traffic as evidenced by accidents spooked horses provoke. They also claim the horse industry is not, has never been nor will ever be properly regulated and the only solution to end the cruel mistreatment of these animals is to ban Central Park carriage horse tours. 

           </br>   </br>
        Conservationists, on the contrary, argue the carriage horse industry is part of an iconic New York City tradition that must be preserved. Not to mention the hundreds of jobs the industry supports. These advocates claim the anti-carriage horse movement is a guise for real estate developers to acquire prime real estate in Manhattan’s Upper West Side where the stables housing the carriage horses are located. They claim the New York City carriage horse industry is well-regulated and vigorously defend the idea that horses and humans can safely work together in midtown Manhattan traffic.

      <p> Meet Chris. On September 26, 2013, the New York Daily News reported Chris got into an    
    accident near Columbus Circle on West 57th Street and 8th Avenue at 10:15am. The spooked horse bolted and flipped its carriage in the middle of the busy midtown street, leaving it pinned under the carriage until a group of good Samaritans lifted the rig off its hind legs. According to its driver, Frank Luo, Chris “freaked out and pulled the harness.” 

     </br>   </br>
    Lou, 43,  a licensed carriage driver since 1996, had been cited the day prior for overcharging and had a history of working steeds more than 12 hours in a 20 hour period. The legal limit is 9 hours a day with 15-minute breaks after every two hours. In addition, the horses cannot work if temperatures go above 90 degrees F or below 18 degrees F regardless of wind factor. 

     </br>   </br>
    “I knew that if I let him go he would have run into traffic, cause accidents and hit people,” said Luo. “I’m very thankful I didn’t get killed."
    Neither Chris nor Lou was injured. </p>

      <p> Meet Pumpkin. On June 10, 2014, Pumpkin bolted through the streets of midtown Manhattan toward Central Park South and slammed its carriage into a yellow cab. Cristina Hansen, Pumpkin’s driver, said Pumpkin, 7, somehow got out of its bridle. 

     </br>   </br>
     “The horse was frightened and shaky,” said William Paul, a tourist from Florida who tried to stop the steed. 

     </br>   </br>
     “Having a terrified 2,000-pound horse run wildly into Central Park is an unnecessary threat to public safety,” said Mary Culpepper of the Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages. “The public has a right to know how dangerous carriage rides are and how dangerous it is to have horses in the middle of noisy, traffic-congested city.” </p>

      <p> Meet Bernie. On October 20, 2014, the New York Post reported Bernie ran away from Byrne Stables in 547 West 37th Street and trotted all the way to 10th avenue and West 39th street before police vehicles corralled him. According to his owner, Declan Quinn, Bernie’s halter broke from wear and tear. 



     </br>   </br>
     Quinn said the horse had never ran away before, but Allie Feldman, an animal rights activist, said the chase showed “why horse-drawn carriages are not just inhumane but entirely unsafe in a city congested with cars, trucks and buses.”

     </br>   </br>
     No one was hurt in the police chase and Bernie got the day off after he turned Hell’s Kitchen into the Wild Wild West.”

    <div class="text-right">
      <p> Meet Tickles. On March 15, 2015, Tickles, 18, was put down after an unknown injury left it with a fractured leg. Stable workers at Clinton Park Stables first noticed a problem with Tickles a month prior when the steed did not stand up in its stall to eat. According to The Daily News, Veterinarian Dennis Farrell examined the horse and found there was nothing he could do.
 

     </br>   </br>
     After hearing the news of what she termed the “mysterious leg injuries” that led to Tickles’ euthanasia, Martha Stuart wrote a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio demanding an explanation. In her letter she asked Mayor de Blasio to carry out a full investigation into Tickles’ mysterious death to answer questions such as: Did the horse have any prior health problems? How long was it in pain? And if cramped living conditions or other inhumane treatment played a role in its death? 
     Animal rights activists claim the stables where the horses are kept are too small for the animals to comfortably lie down and move around. According to New York City regulation, horse stalls must be at least 60-square-feet even though experts recommend between 144 to 196-square-feet depending on the steed. Most stalls at Clinton Park Stables are 80-square-feet, larger than the requirement. Regardless, Martha Stewart along with other New Yorkers are demanding and eagerly awaiting a necropsy report in Tickles’ case.

     Dr. Farrell’s conclusion that “freak accidents happen” was not enough to assuage these animal rights advocates.
